# snake-app
Snake developed in Android Studio as a hobby project. <status: finished>

The goal was to create an Android application running Snake, coded mostly from scratch, 
in order to get used to working with Android Studio again. Some basic animations were added to regain some familiarity with writing them. 

Still some occasional bugs in the application and semi-messy code but satisfied with the result at this point.
